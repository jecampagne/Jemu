CLASS Pk emulator in JAX
Jump to the [Jemu-demo.ipynb](https://github.com/jecampagne/Jemu/blob/main/Jemu-demo.ipynb) and play with it...
For the time beeing the code is not yet optimized and loading the GPs parameters could take a few minutes. 

Since 6th July 22, I edit some scripts to ease the process to create new CLASS emulator set.
- make_new_cosmo.py: build 1000 cosmological parameters in 5D Latin Hypercube. The current version is minimal to regenerate [Omega_cdm, Omega_b, sigma8, n_s,h] dataset.
